# credit_risk_classification
Module 20 Challenge
Analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to train and evaluate a model for loan risk. It predicts whether the loans will be healthy loans or high-risk loans.

The accuracy score of the machine learning model is 99%.
The precision score and recall score for healthy loans are 1.00 and 0.99.
The precision score and recall score for high-risk loans are 0.84 and 0.94.

I would recommend this model for use by the company because it predicts healthy loans and high-risk loans with a high accuracy.
